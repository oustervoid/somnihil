# Decay
### Overview:
True death remains elusive for many as the Stiffs harness the energy of the recently deceased to empower their prison reality. Those who perish within Nihil are at risk of either being painfully churned into fuel or becoming rendered spirits, corrupted fragments of themselves cursed to wander eternally through the magical infrastructure of Nihil known as the Wired. 

Yet every process must come to an end Ciphers who choose to embrace this truth wield Decay magic to terminate artificial and biological forms of life. They may possess the ability to reanimate lifeforms with temporary consciousness or exploit the weaknesses of their opponents through malicious subroutines. Some have mastered the art of corruption, while others can detect and manipulate the presence of death upon a lifeform or place. 

Ciphers who study Decay often find themselves interacting with spirits to peer past the veil of death for grim and powerful knowledge. Some choose to aid these spirits in their search for true death and respite, while others to conspire with vengeful spirits who seek to wage war against the Stiffs from within the Wired.
