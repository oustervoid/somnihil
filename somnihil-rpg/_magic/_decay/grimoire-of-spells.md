#### Corporeal Banishment ^corporeal-banishment
**_X AP*:_** The Cipher may choose an object within range into the [[Glossary of Terms#The Wired | Wired]], likely to be quickly disintegrated by the Stiff's harvesting systems. The time it takes to dematerialize is determined by size and complexity of the object's structure. 
- **_3 AP:_** The Cipher may choose to cast this spell upon a spirit instead of an object. The Cipher will need to roll if the target of this spell is unwilling to be sent to the Wired in this way.

#### Defensive Entropy ^defensive-entropy
**_5 AP:_**  Once per session, when the Cipher next suffers an attack, they may choose to inflict the same amount of damage against their attacker. Once this spell is used on an attack, if the damage was received from the attack would be enough to set the Cipher's vitality to 0 or cause them to make a **Cheat Death** roll, instead the Cipher's vitality becomes set to 1.

#### Dread Whispers ^dread-whispers
**_2 AP:_** The Cipher's words bring anguish and hopelessness to any target lifeform of their choosing, causing that lifeform's next action be taken at disadvantage.

#### Shade Shaping ^shade-shaping
**_*4 AP:_** The Cipher conjures a phantasmal force to extinguish lights and can alter the placement of shadows to impair the vision of all lifeforms while channeling this spell. All lifeforms within range roll at disadvantage when making attacks or casting spells. The Cipher may also choose to change the shape and intensity of shadows in range. The Cipher may cast spells, move, and take non-magical actions unimpeded. 

#### Shade Stepping ^shade-stepping
**_2 AP:_** The Cipher may choose to step into the shadows near them and reappear from any other shadow within eyesight. 

#### Ghastly Servitor ^ghastly-servitor
**_3 AP:_** The Cipher impresses a simple command within a nearby corpse, reanimating it with a temporary vitality and autonomous programming. The commands the Cipher can integrate into the corpse are limited to short logic loops, accommodating only simple tasks and requiring reinstruction often in order to achieve the intent of the Cipher. These reanimated corpses are often used as watchdogs, bodyguards, and to perform basic housekeeping tasks. 

#### Ghastly Gaze ^ghastly-gaze
**_1 AP:_** This ability can be used upon corpses to determine their cause and time of death. This can allow them to detect the otherwise undetectable details of a death, such as the presence of neural toxins in a body from a pile of ashes or the bite marks that rended the fossilized bones of an exinct species of animal. 

#### Grim Gaze ^grim-gaze
**_2 AP:_** Casting this spell causes the Cipher to see an ephemeral aura around all lifeforms nearby that shows how often they have encountered death in their life and how recently they have encountered death. This allows the Cipher to know if someone is in mourning or can be used reveal the identity and location of a murderer blending into a crowd.  

#### Sanctum of Twilight ^sanctum-of-twilight
? AP: The Cipher creates a portal in an area around them while channeling this spell that moves every lifeform within range into the [[Glossary of Terms#The Wired| Wired]], rendering their physical bodies into a dispersed collection of magical essence. While within this field, lifeforms are able to pass through walls physical objects and move in any direction without resistance from gravity or interference from the power recyclers hidden throughout the Wired. The Cipher may cast spells, move, and take non-magical actions unimpeded while channeling this spell. 

####  Seal of Binding ^seal-of-binding
**_X AP:_** With the consent and cooperation of a spirit, the Cipher binds their essence within a corporeal body, usually using a corpse as the vessel to house the spirit. The Cipher may also choose to shape a form from ectoplasmic energy, a body that will disintegrate more rapidly but allows the bound ghost to levitate and move freely between the barriers between the physical world and the Wired. The costs for each of these forms are calculated in the following ways:
-  **_X AP:_** The rate of decay until a reanimated corpse unravels from rot is one scene for every action point spent. 
- **_X AP:_** The rate of decay for until an ectoplasmic form disperses is three turns for every action point spent.  

#### Summon an End ^summon-an-end
**_X AP:_** The Cipher is able to manipulate the bodies of the deceased into monstrous amalgamations, distorting proportions and melding the flesh of the dead into a singular grizzly reanimated guardian. This creature's vitality is equal to the number of action points used when creating it, with a minimum amount of points required determined by the Chronicler. This reanimated creature will attempt to defend the Cipher from damage and can be instructed to attack for three damage at the cost of one of its vitality. 

#### Termination Leyline ^termination-leyline
**_3 AP:_** Disrupt all running programming and create dead zones where only the most resilient systems are able to maintain function while all others shutdown or crash. The Cipher may selectively chose which systems to spare from their feild of disruption, giving them a significant edge in committing subterfuge. While channeling this spell the Cipher can stop or disrupt non-magical electrical or mechanical processes in range. The Cipher may cast spells, move, and take non-magical actions unimpeded while channeling this spell. 

#### Wire Traping ^wire-traping
**_4 AP:_** The Cipher is able to guide a recently deceased lifeform's soul away from the harvesting system of the Stiffs to ensure they become a spirit within the Wired. This may only succeed with the consent and cooperation of the deceased lifeform that is deceased. The ability to extend this protection is determined by the Chronicler and the amount of time passed since the lifeform died will increase the probability of this spell not succeeding.
