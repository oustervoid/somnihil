#### Phantasmal Phasing ^phantasmal-phasing
**_2 AP*:_** The Cipher loosens their essence to make themselves harder to target with attacks and spells. Until the Cipher's next turn any attempt to attack or target the Cipher will require a roll at disadvantage to succeed. 
-  **_2 AP:_** The Cipher momentarily flickers their essence out of reality, no longer being able to be targeted by spells that target lifeforms while under this spell's effect.

#### Retaliatory Mimicry ^retaliatory-mimicry
**_2 AP*:_** With instantaneous inversion the Cipher contorts a spell targeting them, nullifying the spell's effects and allowing them to cast a spell as a counterattack by choosing a spell of equal AP cost spent on that spells's Protocol type. However, as the Doomsayer can no longer control other Protocol spells since their demise they take one setback of the Chronicler's choosing by casting this spell. 
- **_X AP:_** By spending more points at the time of casting, the Cipher may choose to cast a spell at one additional action point cost from that spell's protocol for each additional point spent with this ability. 
- **_2 AP:_** The Cipher defies fate with the intensity of using this ability, negating any setback that would have been applied when casting this spell. 

#### Weathered Dispersion ^weathered-dispersion
**_2 AP*:_** The Cipher channels this spell to cause any spell targeting them to be converted into a temporary Anomoly. While channeling this spell the Cipher may not cast any spells but may move and take non-magical actions unimpeded. Any spell that targets the Cipher will fail and every lifeform within range of the Cipher takes disadvantage until the beginning of the Cipher's next turn. While channeling this spell the Cipher may choose to enhance its effects with the following abilities:
- **_2 AP_** The Cipher chooses which lifeforms in range receive a disadvantage on their rolls in response to having a spell targeted towards the Cipher while channeling this spell. 
- **_1 AP_** The Cipher forces a target in range to target only them with their next attempt to cast a spell. 

#### Unforgettable Mistake ^unforgettable-mistake
**_2 AP:_** The Cipher becomes aware of any manipulations to time that occur over their next three turns and may choose to alert any number of target lifeforms in range that were involved in the rewound timeline to know the events that would have occurred had time not been influenced by magic. 

#### Shredding Sunder ^shredding-sunder
**_3 AP:_** The Cipher phases their essence out of reality enough to avoid any damage until their next turn. When this spell is cast, every object in range becomes caught in a violent invisible vortex, dealing damage to all lifeforms within range. The total amount of damage dealt to lifeforms depends on the objects in the scene and is determined by the Chronicler, however the sheer force of this spell deals at minimum two damage to all lifeforms regardless of the objects in the scene. 

#### Engulfed in Spectral Flames ^engulfed-in-spectral-flames
**_2 AP:_** The Cipher ignites their essence, converting their body into a raging intangible fire. While channeling this spell any lifeform within reach of the Cipher takes one point of damage at the beginning of their turn for as long as they remain within reach to the Cipher. These flames can only be faintly perceived by other lifeforms capable of seeing magic and will not cause an [[Glossary of Terms#Anomaly | anomaly]]  if witnessed by a [[Glossary of Terms#Dreamers | dreamer]]. If a dreamer is harmed by this spell however then this spell immediately ends. The Cipher may cast spells, move, and take non-magical actions while channeling this spell. 

#### Beseech the Wired ^beseech-the-wired
**_3 AP:_** The Cipher loosens the barriers between their current location and the Wired while also inviting nearby spirits to assist them in their current endeavor or in attacking a target lifeform in range. The Chronicler works with the Cipher to determine the damage dealt by any nearby spirits and they gain advantage on first action each turn while the spirit chooses to be present.

#### Null Tunneling ^null-tunneling
**_3 AP:_** The Cipher chooses a location they have previously encountered or can vividly imagine and diffuses their essence to travel to that location instantaneously. This spell can be used to allow the Cipher to travel into the Wired or Nowhere as well as anywhere in Nihil. 

#### Infinity's Crosshairs ^infinitys-crosshairs
**_2 AP_** While the Cipher channels this spell they may make attacks that distort reality in order to connect with their target. The Cipher may choose any lifeform within range to make a melee or ranged attack against or cast in reach spells at range instead. The Cipher may cast spells, move, and take non-magical actions unimpeded. 

#### Blades of the Destroyer ^blades-of-the-destroyer
**_3 AP:_** The Cipher summons blades of pure unreality, allowing the Cipher to deal 3 damage on melee attacks or make a ranged  attack against a target for 2 damage by sending a pulse of energy from the tip of their conjured blades. 

#### Bestow Unwoven Form ^bestow-unwoven-form
**_X AP:_** The Cipher chooses a target lifeform in range to gain the benefit of moving in any direction and through objects as if they were a spirit for a number of turns equal to the amount of action points spent when casting this spell. 

#### Greater Invisibility ^greater-invisibility
**_2 AP:_** The Cipher becomes invisible and cannot be perceived by any lifeforms in range or by non-magical surveillance systems. The Cipher continues to remain invisible while they channel this spell and can cast spells, move, and take non-magical actions unimpeded. 

#### Cancel Channel ^cancel-channel
**_3 AP_** The Cipher targets any lifeform within range that js currently channeling a spell and forcibly ends that spell immediately. 

#### Unmaking Parry ^unmaking-parry
**_4 AP*:_** The next successful melee attack the Cipher makes will cause their opponent to lose grip on any weapon or object they are holding. Within seconds of becoming disarmed, the weapon or object disintegrates into dust. 
 -  **_2 AP_** The Cipher may choose an additional target lifeform to gain the benefit of this spell at the time of casting. 

#### Shrieking Stillness
**_2 AP:_** The Cipher loosens a scream that disorients a target lifeform within reach, rendering them incapacitated until the beginning of the Cipher's next turn.
