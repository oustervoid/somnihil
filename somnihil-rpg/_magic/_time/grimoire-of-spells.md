#### Flux the Future ^flux-the-future
**_2 AP:_** The Cipher may grant themselves or any target in range advantage on their next roll. The Cipher may immediately cast this spell targeting themselves for no cost once per day when they would have disadvantage on a roll, allowing them the best possible odds to shape their future even in the worst circumstances. 

#### Cyclic Sustain ^cyclic-sustain
**_4 AP*:_** The Cipher begins channeling a spell that allows them to loop the last few seconds of any action taken by a single target in range, rendering them unable to act in any different way as long as the Cipher continues to channel this spell. While in many cases this can effectively immobilize a target opponent, this spell can also be used to gain access to restricted areas by looping the scanning of a badge, or force a firearm into unloading its entire clip in one direction. The Cipher cannot cast any other spells while channeling this spell but may move and take non-magical actions unimpeded. 
- **_2 AP:_** The Cipher may choose one additional target in range to loop their last few seconds of action while channeling this spell. 

#### Pour a Drained Cup ^pour-a-drained-cup
**_X AP:_** By invoking this spell the Cipher is able to align the future towards obtaining an object of their desire. The more immediate the need for obtaining the targeted object, their distance away from the targeted object, and the probability of them receiving it indirectly versus the Cipher manaully manipulating events in time to their favor to obtain the object influences the cost of this spell. The following is a suggested approach for resolving this spell, but it is also encouraged for the Cipher and Chronicler to collaboratively decide on what happens:
- **_2  AP:_** Within seven days the Cipher comes into possession of great wealth or the targeted object, as determined by the Chronicler. 
- **_3 AP:_** Within three days the Cipher comes into possession of moderate wealth or the targeted object, as determined by the Chronicler. The Cipher also suffers one setback of the Chronicler's choosing.
- **_4 AP:_** Within a day the Cipher comes into possession of a small amount of wealth or the targeted object, as determined by the Chronicler. The Cipher also suffers two setbacks of the Chronicler's choosing.
- **_6 AP:_** The Cipher rolls to gain possession of the targeted object within an hour, with unsuccessful attempts yielding nothing of substance. Alternatively, successes could result in an object of usefulness being obtained but not the originally intended object. The object obtained is ultimately determined by the Chronicler. The Cipher also suffers two setbacks of the Chronicler's choosing but only if they receive the targeted object or a useful alternative. 

#### Postcognitive Glean ^postcognitive-glean
**_3 AP:_** The Cipher gains the ability to perceive a past event experienced by any object or lifeform within reach. The Cipher may choose to focus on a specific event if they know the time and place the event took place that involved their target. If the specific details are unknown, the Cipher may roll to see if they recover any details relevant to the event they were attempting to perceive. 

#### Forgotten Past, Veiled Future ^forgotten-past-veiled-future
**_4 AP:_** While channeling this spell the Cipher's actions become imperceptible to time and their past suddenly becomes shrouded. While under this effect, the Cipher cannot be perceived on non-magical surveillance, attempts to perceive their location with non-magical means will fail, and magical attempts to perceive their existence through time will yeild no information. Knowledge of the Cipher's actions will be retained by those who knew of it before this spell was cast, but any other attempt to gain this knowledge about the Cipher will fail while this spell is being channeled. The Cipher can cast spells, move, and take actions unimpeded by the effort required to maintain this spell. While useful for evasion, channeling this spell for long periods may cause the Cipher to lose their own memory if used multiple sessions in a row. 

#### Unwind the Harm ^unwind-the-harm
**_3 AP:_** The Cipher is able to rewind time and retake a previous action as though it were the first time occurring to all other lifeforms in range. This does not revert any damage or effects from the first turn that was taken for the Cipher casting this spell, but it has the potential to prevent any damage that would have occurred to other lifeforms depending on the Cipher's new decided course of action. 

#### Time Slip ^time-slip
**_2 AP:_** By extending the dimension of time around an attack, the Cipher may chose to prevent an attack in range or in reach from successfully hitting them so long as they move after casting this spell. 

#### Ascended Acceleration ^accended-acceleration
**_5 AP:_** Through diluting their own experience of time, Cipher extends their ability to respond to the space around them. By channeling this spell the Cipher may take two additional actions and an additional move action per turn. The Cipher may not cast any other spells while channeling this spell but may move and take non-magical actions unimpeded. 

#### Flutter Step ^flutter-step
**_2 AP*:_** The Cipher skips forwards in time in quick and disorienting paces, confusing any opponents in range. After casting this spell, any attempts to harm the Cipher will be at disadvantage until the Cipher completes two move actions. 
- **_2 AP:_** The Cipher may cast this spell on one additional target in range. 

#### Glade of Respite ^glade-of-respite
**_4 AP*:_** The Cipher grinds time to a halt all around them and may chose to move freely while the rest of the world remains frozen in time. After the Cipher casts this spell, time will be frozen for the next two turns, allowing them to move or interact with their environment. If the Cipher makes contact or attacks another lifeform after this spell is cast then that lifeform is unfrozen and may interact as they choose for the duration of this spell's effect. 
 - **_3 AP:_** The Cipher may extend this spell indefinitely if they chose to channel it at the time of casting. The Cipher may not cast any other spells and takes disadvantage on any actions taken while maintaining the concentration required for this spell. The Cipher may move unimpeded while this spell is active. 

#### Superior Augery ^superior-augery
**_4 AP:_** With perfect clarity the Cipher predicts the immediate future. The Cipher may ask one question about the upcoming turn planned for an opponent and the Chronicler can share as much detail as is possible given the current scenario and environment around the Cipher. The Cipher gains advantage on their next roll during the turn they glimpsed by casting this spell. 
- **_1 AP:_** The Cipher chooses a target lifeform in range to share their vision of the future. The target also receives advantage on their next roll during the turn they revealed a vision of. 

#### Future Proofing ^future-proofing
**_6 AP:_** The Cipher opens their mind to the most significant milestones ahead of them and seeks the path with the best odds of success. By casting this spell, the Cipher may ask the Chronicler for advice about taking an action in response to a current event or about an event seen in the future. The Chronicler can be asked three questions about an action the Cipher is considering taking receives advantage on any roll associated with the action should they decide to commit it after receiving answers to their inquiry. 

#### Unrelenting Age ^unrelenting-age
**_X AP:_** The Cipher chooses an inanimate object within range and simulates a great span of time to wear the object into disarray or even dust. The structure and composition of the object effects the cost and time needed for the completion of this spell, but in most cases it costs a single AP for every ten years of time passed on the object. The Chronicler may choose to impose disadvantage, setbacks, or adjust the AP cost as needed. 

#### Anachronic Haze  ^anachronic-haze
**_X AP:_** Through harnessing fluctuations in time the Cipher imposes the worst odds for their opponents and bolsters their allies attacks. For each 2 AP spent when casting this spell, the Cipher chooses a target in range to receive advantage or disadvantage on all of their rolls until the beginning of the Cipher's next turn. 

#### Quantum Precision ^quantum-precision
**_2 AP:_** The Cipher shifts time instinctively so that their next attack has the most potential to harm. The next attack the Cipher successfully makes deals an additional 2 damage. 
- **_1 AP:_** The Cipher chooses a target in range to receive the effect of this spell.
