# Timing 
### Overview:
Everything that is yet to be lies in a linear progression according to the cruel whims of the Stiffs. Yet this flow is malleable by design, and through a mastery of chaining events together seamlessly with Timing spells Ciphers may shift the flow of time in their favor. Nothing is truly fixed in place within the events transpiring within Nihil, since everything is in a perpetual stasis. Cipher's studying Timing seek to manipulate the pacing of what has come before and what was meant to occur ahead. 

Spellcasters of the the Timing Protocol may exert control to shift the future into the most advantageous outcome, while those with even greater mastery may incrementally bend the past to undue the injustices dealt by the Stiffs' chokehold on timelines. Some may possess the ability shuffle events into inexplicable occurrence, leading to events of unimaginable devestation or celebration with the simple folding of casualty, like disasters brought by the fluttering wings of butterflies in flight. 

While the Stiffs cling to their fragile eternity, Ciphers weilding Timing spells seek to unwind the occurrence of events across reality to unmake the foresworn lich rulers. With their power they aim to align the universe into an everlasting bliss for every moment that has been spent suffering across the entire history of imprisonment in Nihil.
