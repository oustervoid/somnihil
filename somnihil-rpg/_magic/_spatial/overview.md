# Spatial 
### Overview:
All that exists within Nihil is woven within the an unimaginable collection of containers, a series of interconnected points between a sea of processes, and Spatial spells allow Ciphers to traverse through these waves of invocations to arrive anywhere they chose to be. Imprisonment and isolation weilded by the Stiffs and their enforcers as deterrence to rebellion are subverted by the constant jailbreaks and hit and run tactics employed by those weilding Spatial spells. 

With this magic the Cipher folds space around them to travel around the world in a single step. Some are capable of extending their own senses and control of their surroundings to listen into distant locations or to walk through a gunfight without crossing the trajectory of a single bullet. Though the most vexing threat these spellcasters pose to the Stiffs is the ability to create pockets of Nowhere, spaces that are imperceptible to those within Nihil. As the Stiff's and Shill's power rely upon existing in their reality, Nowhere is the one place they cannot enter. 

The intrepid Spatial spellcaster is a traveler capable of transporting themselves and others exactly where the Stiffs don't want them to be. They act as spies and information couriers, facilitating conversations across a universal battlefield of united Awakened. The Stiffs fight to keep their thrones in a battlefield existing everywhere and Nowhere thanks to the magic and espionage of bestowed through using Spatial magic.
