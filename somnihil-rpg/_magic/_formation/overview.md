# Formation
### Overview:
Every thing and every person can be bought, as the Stiffs enforce scarcity to fuel desperation and compliance within their flawed reality. With the exception of a few wealthy elites chosen to serve the Stiffs, the majority of the population struggles to survive despite the prosperity of the corporations they toil under. 

Cipher's who weild Formation spells seek to bring balance to the world by striking at its material structure and innate dynamics. Every bit and byte is malleable, and the these Cipher's weild spells to reconstruct reality in opposition to its creators' malicious intent. They may conjure entire objects from seemingly thin air or set objects ablaze with a glare. Some choose to become artisans, sculpting steel as if it were clay while others choose to wield the forces of animated matter to make the world move and transform as they please. 

By harnessing the raw energy of Nihil as a weapon, Formation spellcasters take a stand against any who would threaten prosperity with serfdom or rebellion with shackles.
