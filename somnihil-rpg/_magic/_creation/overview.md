# Creation 
### Overview:
There burns an invisible fire within Nihil, and it is in the pulse of this heat that all magic is born. Ciphers that possess knowledge of Creation spells hold themselves as vessels to this imperceptible wave of fiery inspiration. This power of shaping the multitude of conditions and rules behind the creation and interaction of all magic in Nihil was once known only by the Stiffs, the original authors of every instance of their cursed existence. But much to the chagrin of the Stiffs, this magic of making and unmaking is now also in service to the collective of artists and poets that claim the power of Creation magic as their own. 

Ciphers possessing knowledge of Creation magic can create constructs of pure magic to act as proxies of their own existence and repository of mana. These proxies soon transform into familiars, lifeforms that are connected to the Cipher's pool of magic, but are their own beings with a distinct and unique awareness of the reality around them. Many act as guardians, advisors, and lifelong companions to the Cipher they are first connected with, but it is not unheard of for familiars to drift apart from Ciphers or connect across multiple Ciphers over time. Ciphers who weild Creation magic are also capable of draining the magic from the mundane creations around them to invigorate their own powers or dispell magic that is weilded against them. 

The vivid magics and expressive lives of Creation spellcasters stand in sharp contrast to the reductive conditions demanded by the Stiffs. Through careful design and conjuration the Ciphers using Creation magic strive to instill hope in their allies and weild a power that burns imperceptibly but brightly within the hearts of every Awakened and [[Glossary of Terms#Dreamers | Dreamers]] in Nihil.
