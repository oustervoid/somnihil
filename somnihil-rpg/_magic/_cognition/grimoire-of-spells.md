#### Reveal Intent ^reveal-intent
**_1 AP:_** The Cipher chooses a target lifeform within range and gains the ability to know if the target intends to cause harm to the Cipher or any of their allies. 

#### Splintering Psionics ^splintering-psionics
**_2 AP:_** The Cipher chooses a 
target in reach and begins channeling this spell. While the Cipher channels this spell they may choose to use their target as the origin for any spell they cast when calculating distance for the spell. This allows the Cipher to cast at reach or in range spells from their target when they may otherwise would be too far to successfully aim the spell. While channeling this spell the Cipher may cast spells, move, and take any non-magical action unimpeded by the effort required to maintain this spell. 

#### Mental Mask ^mental-mask
**_2 AP:_** The Cipher sheilds their mind and aura from being perceived and instead chooses the emotion or thoughts that will be seen by any lifeform attempting to observe the Cipher's thoughts or motivations. For the next two turns, any attempt to understand the Cipher's motivations or current expression is perceived exactly as the Cipher intends.

#### Instinctive Jolt ^instinctive-jolt
**_2 AP*:_** The Cipher shifts their mind into multiple asynchronous threads, allowing them to take two additional actions this turn. 
- **_1 AP:_** This spell can be augmented to extend its effects into the Cipher's next turn for an additional AP cost. 

#### Pass without Notice ^pass-without-notice
**_4 AP:_** While channeling this spell the Cipher gains advantage on hiding or moving undetected while any lifeforms nearby gain disadvantage when attempting to perceive the Cipher. Any targets that fail their roll to see the Cipher quickly forget what the focus of their attention was and their memory of seeing the Cipher fades. The Cipher cannot cast any other spell while channeling this spell, but may move and take non-magical actions unimpeded. This spells effect is broken if the Cipher begins attacking any lifeforms or if the Cipher's actions would visibly show intent to harm any lifeforms or objects within the scene. 

#### Rogue Nerves ^rogue-nerves
**_3 AP:_** By twisting and overwhelming a target opponent's nerve endings, the Cipher signals the muscles to contort and relax independently from the target's own intention, effectively immobilizing them. This effect persists for the lifeform until the end of the Cipher's next turn. 

#### Mental Map ^mental-map
**_4 AP:_** The Cipher spreads out their awareness into the minds of nearby lifeforms to form a mental map of their surroundings. For the rest of the scene the Cipher gains advantage when navigating or searching for anything in their environment. This spell also reveals the presence of other lifeforms within  range and grants the Cipher advantage on any attempts to sneak or hide from the any of the lifeforms whose minds were scanned. 

#### Dizzying Double ^dizzying-double
**_3 AP*:_** The Cipher creates a duplicate image of themselves or an ally in the minds of all lifeforms within range. This copy deals no damage, but is a perfect replication of the target with movements independent from the targeted lifeform. Until the beginning of their next turn, all attempts to attack the targeted lifeform will be at disadvantage. 
- **_1 AP:_** The Cipher may choose to target an additional target to receive the benefit of this spell. All duplicates move seperately from the targeted lifeforms and will attempt to confuse enemies as much as possible even after the source of their dubious appearance is discovered. 
- **_X AP:_** Each additional amount of AP spent to cast this spell increases the duration of turns the duplicate remains in existence. 
- **_1 AP:_** The Cipher may cast an at reach spell from their duplicate image as though they were casting the spell from that distance. 

#### Memory Seive ^memory-seive
**_4 AP*:_** The Cipher chooses a target in range and searches for a memory of the Ciphers choosing. If the memory exists, the Cipher experiences it with vivid clarity and from the perspective of the target, feeling their emotions and faintly hearing their thoughts throughout the event. While this experience of memory will feel similar to its duration for the target, any lifeform observing the Cipher will only perceive a brief moment pass before they return from their peek into another lifeform's mind. 
- **_2 AP*:_** The Cipher may choose to project a memory of their own or a memory observed from using this spell previously into the mind of any willing target lifeform in range. 
    - **_3 AP:_** While projecting a memory with this spell the Cipher may pay an additional cost to alter details of the memory to distort the events of experience in ways of their choosing. 

#### Open Mind Sourcing ^open-mind-sourcing
**_4 AP*:_** The Cipher seeks a peice of information or to emulate a known skill from any lifeforms in their nearby environment. The player may ask the Cipher for the answer to a question or if there is any lifeform that can expertly perform an action they intend their Cipher to take. If it is possible and the Chronicler agrees, then the Cipher instantly knows the answer to their question or gains advantage on their next roll associated with the skill they have psychically leeched. 
- **_2 AP*:_** The Cipher may choose a target lifeform in range to receive the benefits of this spell, projecting the question and answer into their target's mind or by providing an instant impression of taking a specific action with advantage if the target lifeform performs that action on their turn. 
    - **_3 AP:_** When casting this spell on a target lifeform with the intent to share a skill, the Cipher may choose to channel this spell in order to give the target advantage on all rolls that involve the skill while this spell is channeled. The Cipher may not cast any other spells while channeling this spell, but may move and take non-magical actions unimpeded.

#### Imprint Impression ^imprint-impression
**_3 AP*:_** With a slight alteration to the perception of language, the Cipher may choose to speak any language in any sort of tone but have it be heard in a manner that is of the Cipher's choosing. By casting this spell the Cipher could choose to leave a great first impression with a lifeform that would otherwise be unable to understand the Cipher's language. This can also be used to allow the Cipher to agitate a lifeform to violence by saying the most insulting or vulgar phrase imaginable without having to know what words to use beforehand. 
- **_2 AP:_** The Cipher may choose to cast this spell on another target lifeform, choosing how other lifeforms around the target will perceive their attempts to communicate. By using this spell in creative ways, the Cipher could sabotage an important diplomatic negotiation or make the most vitriolic language be heard as the babbling of an incoherent child. 

#### Speak into Thought ^speak-into-thought
**_2 AP*:_** The Cipher speaks or sends their words to a target lifeform in range by connecting to the target lifeform's mind. The voice projected is heard perfectly and is perceived as external to the target lifeform's thoughts. The Cipher can express any complex messags instantly and can receive a single response back from the target before the connection between minds is closed. 
- **_1 AP:_** The Cipher may choose to channel this spell when casting it to maintain a permanent connection to the target, allowing them to send messages and speak to one another from any distance away. The Cipher may cast spells, move, and take non-magical actions unimpeded by ths effort required to maintain this spell. 

#### False Face ^false-face
**_3 AP:_** The Cipher is able to channel this spell to appear as a different lifeform by altering how they are perceived. While their body is not physically changed, the Cipher may choose to appear as any lifeform they have previously encountered or choose a target when casting this spell to appear as a lifeform that the target lifeform has a memory of seeing or interacting with. The Cipher may cast spells, move, and take non-magical actions unimpeded by the effort required to maintain this spell. 

####  Psychonaut's Compass ^psychonauts-compass
**_3 AP:_** The Cipher may move their awareness outside of their body, allowing them to perceive their environment without physically being present. While channeling this spell, the Cipher may choose to move their perspective into any adjacent rooms or structures while leaving their body in a fugue state. As the Cipher moves through the environment, they cannot be perceived by non-magical means. Any damage done to the Cipher's body will end this spell and cause the Cipher to snap back to their awareness from the perspective of their body. The Cipher may not move their physical body or take any non-magical actions while channeling this spell, but may cast spells from their body's location at disadvantage. 

#### Cognitive Hijacking ^cognitive-hijacking
**_5 AP:_** The Cipher channels this spell to take possession of a target lifeforms body, moving and taking non-magical actions as though it were their own body. While channeling this spell the Cipher may not move their own body, take non-magical actions with their own body, but may instead move the body of the target lifeform and take non-magical actions. The Cipher may also cast any spells when their possessed lifeform is within reach of the target of the spell. Spells cast this way function as though the Cipher was casting the spell with their own body at the possessed lifeforms location.

The Cipher may choose actions unopposed so long as those actions are in alignment with the possessed target's ethical values. Once the Cipher attempts to do something that the target would be opposed to doing, the Cipher and the possessed lifeform roll for control of the body for that turn. If the Cipher's intent is to harm or destroy something important to the possessed lifeform, the Cipher has disadvantage on the roll. Any damage received to the possessed body or the Cipher's body will instantly end this spell and send the Cipher's awareness back to a perspective from their own body.
