# Cognition 
### Overview 
All thoughts exist as expressions within the confines of the Stiffs' corrupted creation, and Ciphers that study Cognitive magic can disrupt the flow of communication that exists between all constructs that toil within Nihil. As minds are molded into being made unaware of the magic around them and indoctrinated into the hopeless labor of the Stiffs' reality, Ciphers that weild Cognitive magic break these constraints through mental introspection and inner reflection. 

By casting spells of this Protocol, Ciphers are able to perceive the auras of emotions and thoughts around them. Some are even capable of tapping the minds of conscious beings around them, perceiving their memories with the same sensory levels of the original experience. Other Ciphers may harness the capacity of external minds to leech knowledge or run seperate queries of thought within the minds of the lifeforms around them. 

Many Cognitive spellcasters believe that the unlimited prowess of the mind can transform the world into a place of peace and intersubjectivity. Through perception and reflection the individual may break free of the crumbling processes embedded into their actions from faulty memory and mental manipulation. Existence is generated through beholding the external world, and the Ciphers that harness Cognitive magic aim to puncture the Stiffs' veil to awaken the collective minds of humanity.
