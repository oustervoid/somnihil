# Sequence 
### Overview:
What may appear to be a series of unrelated tragedies and blessings hides the weavers of patterns and fate. Ciphers harnessing the power or Sequence magic intuitively know the cause and effect that drives events to happen. With this knowledge they can bend these effects to create their desired outcomes. While the Stiffs use this layer of interconnected fates for oppression, Ciphers studying this Protocol seek to shape these mystic threads to bring about a [[Glossary of Terms#Zero Day | Zero Day]] to permanently end the perpetual loop of Nihil. 

With Sequence magic Ciphers may bestow blessings of good fortune and shift the odds in the favor of their allies. They also are equally capable of spinning destiny to ensnare their foes in deadly misfortune and woe. Some believe deeply in concepts of destiny and fate, admiring the ever changing ripples across its vast web of connections. Other groups of Ciphers weilding Sequence magic choose to bend the linkages between odds and chance, breaking apart the sequence of events in every moment to defiantly oppose the Stiffs' attempts to restrict self-determination. 

Sequence magic perceive the ties that bind every action within Nihil, and with the slightest touch they seek to ensure eternal freedom and possibility with the confidence that comes from inescapable probability.
