# Pointers Full Grimoire

#### Trick Shot ^trick-shot
**_2 AP:_** The Cipher defies seemingly impossible odds to land their next ranged attack. The next time the Cipher would make a ranged attack they may choose to roll the dice twice and choose the which result to determine the outcome. Any penalties that would be applied to this ranged attack roll are not considered for determining the outcome of the roll. 

#### Contort Calculations ^contort-calculations
**_X AP*:_** The Cipher bends the the trajectory of incoming projectiles to avoid taking damage until the beginning of their next turn. The closer the the Cipher is to the source of the projectile will determine the action point cost:
- **_Too Far (1 AP):_** The opponent targeting the Cipher is too far to score a successful hit, however the Cipher may still influence the attempted attack to hit any other target within the Cipher's range. 
- **_In Range (1 AP):_** The opponent's attack misses the Cipher, regardless of the outcome of the roll. 
- **_In Reach or Nearby (3 AP):_** The Cipher distorts the odds of being struck by projectiles to absolute absurdity. Guns unexpectedly jam, spells fizzle out, and even the environment shifts to sabotage any ranged attacks made against the Cipher from any range.
- **_1 AP:_** Additionally, the Cipher may spend one additional action point to change the target of this spell to apply its benefits to a target lifeform instead of themselves. Calculate the cost of the spell based on the position of the target lifeform and the distance between them and their attacker. 

#### Swing And Miss ^swing-and-miss
**_X AP:_** AP: The Cipher curves fate against the next melee attack they are targeted by. Upon becoming the target of a melee attack, the Cipher may choose one of the following outcomes to occur:

- **_Reversal (2 AP):_** The failed melee attack instead injures the opponent or a nearby target of the Cipher's choosing.
- **_Reckless Abandon (1 AP):_** The failed melee attack causes the opponent to be knocked prone in reach of the Cipher. 
- **_Weakened Grasp (3 AP)*:_** The failed melee attack causes the opponent to become disarmed.
  - **_1 AP_** The Cipher may spend one additional action point to gain possession of their opponent's weapon after disarming them. 

#### Baleful Eye ^baleful-eye
**_2 AP*:_** The Cipher invokes immediate misfortune to a target lifeform within range. The target will roll at disadvantage on its next action. 
- **_2 AP*:_** The Cipher may include other targets within eyesight to suffer from this spell for for two action points per additional target. 

#### Fortune's Favorite ^fortunes-favorite
**_2 AP*:_** The Cipher coaxes the best possible outcome from fate for their next action, allowing them to roll with advantage on their next roll. 
- **_2 AP*:_** The Cipher may include other target lifeforms within range to benefit from this spell for for two action points per additional target. 

#### Boundless Action ^boundless-action
**_1 AP:_** On the Cipher's next roll, consider *19* and *20* to yeild *Triumph* outcomes. All other outcomes remain the same.

#### Lucky Charm ^lucky-charm
**_1 AP:_** The Cipher chooses an object within range and imbues it with their choice of the following boons:

- **Wellspring of Wealth:** An individual given the imbuded object for a day will come into possession of a desired material resource after the session has ended. 

- **Uncovered Secrets:** An individual given the imbuded object will discover hidden knowledge after a day has passed. 

The bearer of the imbued object may make the result of this spell more beneficial or precise by carrying the object with them while pursuing the desired outcome. However, this spell will end without bestowing its benefit if the object is destroyed during the session this spell is cast during. 

#### Never Down or Out ^never-down-or-out
**_3 AP:_** By abstracting form from function, a Cipher may make machines perform at optimal performance regardless of their overall condition. This allows for vehicles that are in complete disrepair to roar to life with the Cipher at the wheel, or could enable a Cipher to make a reinforced security door suddenly fling open at their touch. 

#### Transient Wealth ^transient-wealth
 **_5 AP:_** Fate and fortune are as intertwined as the moon and the tides of the sea. With an awareness of the coming waves, a Cipher can reap great reward by making informed decisions ahead of their occurrence. However, these fortunes are often not long lasting and the Cipher may find that refusing to relinquish possessions obtained in this way can lead to ruin.

The Cipher may choose to aquire any object of Gear, Cybernetics, or Commodities of their choosing and it will come into their possession within three turns. Any Cipher may use the item with no consequence for a single scene. Afterwards if any Cipher retains possession of the object after the scene they will be at disadvantage when they attempt to use it and the benefits of rolling a **_Triumph_** are negated, only allowing the action to mildly succeed. 

#### Opportune Momentum ^opportune-momentum
**_3 AP*:_** By activating this spell, a Cipher may target all opponents within range or closer and make an non-magical melee or ranged attacks with advantage despite the improbability of their attack being able to accomplish this action. 
- **_2 AP:_** The Cipher may chose an a target lifeform to gain the effect of this spell.

#### Cascading Failures ^cascading-failures
**_5  AP:_** The Cipher channels all of their magic into tearing apart the folds of Fate, creating chaos with each slash against the delicate tapestry of destiny. Machines begin to malfunction and overload, improbable failures in infrastructure result in power grids surging and shuttimg down, and hysteria grips nearby Sleepers. All opponents receive  disadvantage to non-magical actions while the Cipher channels this spell. The Cipher may not cast spells while channeling this spell, but may move and take non-magical actions unimpeded. 

#### Vexed for Greatness ^vexed-for-greatness
**_4 AP:_** The Cipher creates a false destiny, weaving a tale of their choosing to lay over an object or lifeform. There can be absolutely no momentum from the object or lifeform towards the events described by the Cipher and it is extremely likely that these events will never happen. 

Yet any lifeform attempting to perceive the future related to that object or lifeform will need to succeed on a roll to be able to dispel the false destiny. If the roll fails, they will be deceived into thinking the events the Cipher described will come to pass unless direct and immediate intervention is taken. 

#### Dooming Strike ^dooming-strike
**_3 AP:_** When in combat, a Cipher may choose a detail from either the environment around them or a nearby lifeform to be the cause for a devastating attack against an opponent within range. 

At the beginning of the targeted opponent's turn, they become fascinated by the chosen detail, allowing the Cipher to make an attack with advantage against the target. Even if the Cipher's attack fails, the opponent will be unable to take any action on their turn other then to respond to the unexpected attack. 

#### Chance Encounter ^chance-encounter
**_2 AP:_** With only a vague location to go on, a Cipher may chose a lifeform they wish to meet and allow Fate to guide their steps. By using this spell the Cipher will be led in the most direct route to their target. Since the distance between the Cipher and their target will need to be traversed in some way, it is advantageous for the Cipher to be near the individual of interest. 

#### Indomitable Probability ^indomitable-probability
**_4 AP:_** The Cipher infuses their intentions for the future into an oath of power. Once per session, the Cipher may gain advantage on their next attack roll and can choose any target within for an attack. 
- **_3 AP:_** Adding three additional action points to the cost of this spell will allow the target chosen to be **_Too Far_** from the Cipher and still be targeted with advantage on the attack. Using this ability in this way does require the Cipher to know their target's current location at the time of casting.
